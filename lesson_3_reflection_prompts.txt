When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- in case you wanted to share your work
- in case others wanted to also contribute toward the work
- in case you wanted to switch back and forth between computers you work from

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- to ensure any changes made by someone else on the repository are pulled in
  before you make any changes
